Purpose
-------
To lead development of a Discord bot that includes a number of features intended to be fun without much of a real,
tangible purpose. It is essentially a bot with no real use or purpose outside of just having it to be enjoyable to
have in a server, similar to the `Toddbot Discord bot <https://top.gg/bot/461265486655520788>`_.

Features Thus Far

- Creating the ability to roast anyone on comand. **(Not implemented as of yet).**
- Anytime that Donald J. Trump posts a tweet, it is sent to the server chat. **(Not implemented as of yet).**
