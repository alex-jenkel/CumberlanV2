Purpose:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead development of a Discord bot that includes a number of features intended
to be fun without much of a real,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tangible purpose. It's essentially a bot with
no real use or purpose outside of just having it to be enjoyable to have in a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server, similar to the Toddbot Discord bot.

Features so far:
• Creating sentences, either in writing or through voice chat, from dictionaries.
• Creating the ability to roast anyone on command.
