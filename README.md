Purpose:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead development of a Discord bot that includes a number of features intended
to be fun without much of a real,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tangible purpose. It's essentially a bot with
no real use or purpose outside of just having it to be enjoyable to have in a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server, similar to the Toddbot Discord bot.

Features of the Cumberlan bot:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Cumberlan bot supports the following features:
    
        -An insult generator, where a user can ask the bot to insult another user,
         where the bot will then post either a gif or an image, at random, to the
         intended user to be insulted. Essentially a roast feature.
        
        -The bot will randomly generate and post a sentence that is constructed at
         random while still making some sort of semantical and grammatical sense.
         The posting will also occur at random.
